- # TO DO (MUST)
    - **Add: ```setPasswordAttribute```** method in User class, so the password be mutated without doning anything in the controller

- # IDEAS (SHOULD)
    - **Use: Strategy DP**, for User related classes like, users, drivers, travelers, personals, etc. Try to use **composition instead of inheritance**.
    - **Seperate: entity access** concerns using different kinds of **repositories** and **service providers**

- # FURTHER STUDIES (NOTE)
